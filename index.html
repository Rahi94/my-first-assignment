            <p class="why-flower-para">What is the importance of flowers in nature? Besides adding color, texture and biodiversity to gardens and ecosystems, flowers are botanically important structures and essential sources of food for many organisms. The flower is an important means of attracting pollinators to a plant, which is necessary in order for the plant to produce seeds, reproductive structures that allow a species to exist generation after generation. Flowers also protect seeds as they develop, ensuring the successful transfer of genetic material to the next generation. Plants that make flowers are called angiosperms, and they are a group that has evolved to encompass a wide range of diversity in size, form and color.</p>
